# Advent of Code 2022

# Why C++ in 2022?

C++ is still a cool language with many advanced features added in the last two standards (C++17 and C++20) and I would like to use the Advent-of-Code to experiment with those features.

## Pre-Requisites

The following pre-requisites are assumed to be installed on a Linux development machine:

- Bazel build system
- Clang (version >= 15.x) with support for C++20

## Run the Code

    bazel build //src/exe/day01:base
